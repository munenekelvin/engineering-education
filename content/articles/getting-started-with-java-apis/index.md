### Introduction
Application Programming Interface(API) is a set of communication protocols and subroutines that allow different programs to communicate.

A programmer can utilize a variety of API tools to make his or her program easier to understand. Additionally, an API allows programmers to construct software programs more efficiently.

In basic terms, an API facilitates communication between two programs or apps by providing them with the tools and services they require. It receives the user's request and sends it to the service provider, after which it sends the service provider's response to the target user.

A developer frequently employs APIs to incorporate numerous functionalities by making API calls rather than writing sophisticated code. We can make an API for a JavaScript file or other object-oriented files, operating systems, database systems, and hardware systems. 

Also, with one crucial exception, an API is identical to a GUI (Graphical User Interface). An API, unlike a GUI, allows software developers to use web tools, whereas a GUI makes a program easier to grasp for users.

#### What are Java APIs
As a part of the JDK, APIs play a vital role. There are three types of APIs in Java: interfaces and classes. In addition to providing real-time information, they allow developers to integrate a wide range of applications and websites.

The Java API is shown in the image below.

The Java API and its components are now familiar to us, so let us see who uses them.

#### Who uses Java APIs
According to their job or project, there are three types of Java API developers:

- Developers on the inside.
- Developers in partnership.
- Developers who are willing to work together.

#### The need for Java APIs
Java programmers use APIs to:

1. **Simplify Operating Procedures**- Several social networking applications provide consumers with many alternatives on one screen. Using Java APIs makes this possible.
2. **Make Effective Applications**- Customers can now manage their funds digitally with ease thanks to APIs, which have revolutionized the sector.
3. **Enhance Business Techniques**- Many firms release private data after releasing APIs to the public to generate new ideas, solve current bugs, and find new methods to enhance operations due to releasing APIs. Using the Twitter developer account, programmers can access Twitter data and develop applications using private API credentials.

We will go over the different types of Java APIs in the sections below.

#### Types of Java APIs
Java has four different types of APIs:

1. **Public**- These are Java APIs that are included with the JDK. Developers can utilize them in any way they see fit.
2. **Private**- Private (or internal) APIs are built by a single company and are only available to employees who work for that company.
3. **Partner**- Organizations build partner APIs, which are considered third-party APIs for strategic business processes.
4. **Composite**- Composite APIs are microservices that are created by integrating multiple service APIs.

Now that we have reviewed the different types of Java APIs let us look at how they are classified based on the services that different Java APIs provide.

#### Data and API services 
There are more ways to categorize Java APIs besides the types discussed above. APIs are further categorized based on their data manipulation capabilities and the services they provide, such as:

1. **Internal API services**- Internal API services are designed to provide businesses with unique services. Only complicated data operations and internal processes are included in these services.
2. **User interface services**- Service for the user interface APIs are open-source programming interfaces that allow programmers to create user interfaces for mobile devices, computers, and other electronic devices.
3. **External API services**- Developers incorporate open-source APIs into an existing application or website using external APIs.
4. **CRUD**- Use of standard storage-unit connection technologies such as JDBC to facilitate data manipulation operations over diverse data storage units such as software as a service and relational database management systems

Let us look at the rules and conventions of Java APIs.

#### API service protocols
The rules and protocols guide the Java APIs' functionality. Different service protocols are used by different APIs. As an illustration, consider the RESTful API service protocol.

Developers must adhere to the following guidelines while creating a standard RESTful API:

1. **Stateless**- A RESTful API is built on a client-server model. It must be stateless.
2. **Client-server**- The RESTful API's client-server model should be fault-tolerant. Both the client and the server are to be self-contained. Client-side modifications should not affect server-side changes and vice versa.
3. **Uniform interface**- The server and clients are the entities of a RESTful API. Client and server interfaces must be consistent when using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) are used to assign resources.
4. **Layered**- Layers create a RESTful API. The API's layers are loosely connected or independent of one another. Each layer promotes encapsulation and contributes to a distinct degree of hierarchy.
5. **Cache**- The application can capture intermediate responses and execute faster in real-time by including a cache memory. The cache memory is also included in a RESTful API.

Following that, we will go over the most often used Java APIs.

#### List of most commonly used Java APIs
1. **REST API** is an application programming interface that adheres to the REST architectural style's limitations and allows users to communicate with RESTful web services.
2. **web API** is an application programming interface with extra layers that regulate interactions and provide options about structure input and output to be shared among systems.
3. **Twitter4J** is an unauthorized Twitter API Java library.
You can seamlessly connect your Java application with the Twitter service using Twitter4J. Twitter4J is a community-built library.
4. **JavaHelp** is both a software and a file format for online help materials which the JavaHelp browser may display. It is primarily used in Java applications and is developed in Java. It can be used for any application, although it does require the JRE to be loaded.
5. **Java Advanced Imaging**(JAI) is a Java platform extension API that lets programmers develop their image modification methods.
JAI is available for Windows, Solaris, and Linux platforms as a free download from Oracle Corporation.
6. **Java Persistence API**(JPA) is a Java standard that allows you to bind Java objects to a relational database. Object-relational mapping is the process of mapping Java objects to database tables and vice versa (ORM). JPA is a specification with several implementations. Hibernate, EclipseLink, and Apache OpenJPA are all popular implementations.
7. **Java Speech API**(JSAPI) is an application programming interface for command and control recognizers, dictation systems, and speech synthesizers that work across platforms. Even though JSAPI defines an interface, third-party implementations such as FreeTTS exist.
8. **Java 3D** is a programming interface for developing three-dimensional graphical programs and applets. It provides developers with high-level constructs for building and manipulating 3D geometry and the structures utilized to render that geometry.
9. **jUSB API** by Windows allows you to use the Java programming language to access any USB device connected to your computer. All sources, binaries, and documentation came from my diploma thesis in the Global Information System Group
10. **Android API** is a web-based "application programming interface" that allows programmers to engage with third-party services. These are the commands that the service's creator has determined will be used to access specific elements of their application.

#### Advantages of Java APIs
1. **Widespread SQL support**- As a result of Java's component-based APIs, many SQL support services are available in user applications.
2. **Efficiency**- Because they allow for quick application deployment, java APIs are incredibly efficient. Furthermore, the data generated by the application is always accessible online.
3. **Automation**- APIs allow machines to upload, download, update, and remove data without the need for human intervention.
4. **Application**- APIs in Java simplify access and deliver services to all of an application's primary software components..
5. **Integration**- Java APIs can be integrated into any application or website, allowing for a fluid user experience and dynamic data delivery.
6. **Scope**- Websites, apps, and information may be readily available to a wide range of users and audiences using Java APIs.
7. **Customization**- Java APIs can be used by developers and organizations to construct applications that personalize the user's experience and personalize the user's data.
8. **Adaptability**- Java APIs are exceptionally flexible and adaptable because they can quickly absorb new features and changes to frameworks and operating systems.

### Conclusion 
Java APIs are handy for developing real-time websites and applications. Knowing Java APIs is the first step to becoming a software developer; the next step is to learn how to become a software developer.

Happy Learning!
